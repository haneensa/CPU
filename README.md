# Description
In this project, a 32-bit non-pipelined processor was design and implementation using VHDL. The processor is tested using a program stored in an instruction memory of type ROM (Read Only Memory). 
# Software used:
ISE/ModelSim

# CPU specification
- Data Memory of 128B
- Instruction memory 
- 32-bit general purpose register: R0 - R7
- Special purpose registers: PC, IR, MAR, MDR
